  \item \textit{Top 20 least frequent words}, chosen randomly out of all those used just once: \\ subsided, world-wide, attended, sensational, persist, invalided, front, depressing, month's, sick, relations, senior, forty-five, yarn, inviting, again-after, seventy, autocratic, social, fondness
  \item \textit{Interesting word usage pattern:} Poirot comes into the book, not right at the beginning, but around the fifth chapter, and then has a \textit{lot} of action before going a bit out of sight again towards the end. The number of usages of "Poirot" in each chapter of the book are [0, 1, 5, 1, 41, 79, 13, 49, 52, 17, 43, 18, 14].
  \item \textit{Look up a quote:} The quote ``A man in love is a sorry spectacle." was found in Chapter $12$.
  \item \textit{Randomly generated sentence:} We used a unigram model, randomly choosing a next word out of all the eligible words, to create a sentence starting with "The" and 20-word long. A few interesting sentences that came out are:
            \begin{itemize}
              \item The jury is that?" ``No." ``Is it on the criminal or two, and wife." ``Ah!" said John. ``What does not
              \item The old friend Japp was frowning perplexedly, and finally settled down the poisoned last moment--which partly your possession. No notice
