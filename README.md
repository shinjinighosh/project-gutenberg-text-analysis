# Text Analysis of books from Project Gutenberg

Interesting analyses of books from Project Gutenberg. Use a book with demarcated chapters if you wish to look up which chapter a quote comes from, or be able to track the progression of a word over chapters.

### How to run

1.  Clone the project using `git clone git@github.com:shinjinighosh/project-gutenberg-text-analysis.git`
2.  Step into the project directory using `cd project-gutenberg-text-analysis`
3.  Choose whichever book you wish to analyse and place the `.txt` or other text file into the directory. Remember to clean headers and footers which are not a part of the book (like publishing information, synopsis, etc.)
4.  Run `python analyse_interactive.py` (or `python3 analyse_interactive.py`, depending on your path) and enjoy! (Remember to correctly state the relative file path of your book, e.g., `Books/863.txt`)

#### Feel free to suggest cool things to add.
